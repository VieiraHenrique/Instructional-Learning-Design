### What is a sticky idea ?

Ideas that :

> Are **understood**
> Are **remembered** > **Change** something.

Think of some "classes" of ideas that stick naturally :

- Urban legends (ok, it's often very sensationalist)
- Proverbs (even with profound moral truth)

These ideas stick for decades, centuries, even millenia.
