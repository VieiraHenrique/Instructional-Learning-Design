### What is a sticky idea ?

Ideas that :

> Are **understood**
> Are **remembered** > **Change** something.

---

Think of some "classes" of ideas that stick naturally :

- Urban legends (ok, it's often very sensationalist)
- Proverbs (even with profound moral truth)

These ideas stick for decades, centuries, even millenia.

### Principles

  &rarr; Aids their memory and understanding.
- **Credible**
  &rarr; Instills belief
- **Emotional**
  &rarr; Makes people care
- **Stories**
  &rarr; Makes people act.

Did you realize their initials form the word **SUCCES** ?
It might be cheesy, but you'll remember it ;)
