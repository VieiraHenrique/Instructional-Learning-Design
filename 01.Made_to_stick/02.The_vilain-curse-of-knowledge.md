# The vilain : The curse of knowledge.

### The tapper/listener experiment

Think of the `tapper/listener` experiment :

The tapper taps a song on the table, the listener has to guess what song it is.

The most interesting is that the tapper thinks that the chance the listener will get it right is 1 in 2.
The tapper thinks this is a pretty easy game.

The truth is that they find it 1 in 40 !!! Why ?

> When the tapper taps, he taps to the song playing in his head. It seems obvious to him ! (**he has the knowledge** of the correct song)

When the listener listens, he hears a bunch of disconnected taps, like some kind of strange Morse code.

This phenomenon is the **CURSE OF KNWOLEDGE**.

This is the **curse of the expert** :

> Once I know something, it makes it harder for me to communicate what I know.

(Think of doctors, lawyers, IT professionals... they are cursed by their very knowledge.)

Experts speak in jargon, abstraction, technical language.

> They skip links in a chain of logic that seem intuitive to them, but not to us.

**We must translate our expert ideas into a form that the audience can understand**
