# CREDIBLE

&rarr; Instilling belief

---

Why do you believe the things you believe ?

#### External Credibility

**Authorities**: The president, the police, your mom...

**Experts**: They have studied. They know what they’re talking about.

**Celebrities**: We want to be like them. If they believe this, so do we!

**Anti-authority**: “concrete authorities”. People that have been trough. A war survivor, for example...

#### Internal Credibility

**Details**: Make it seem more real. (Same principle of concreteness: brings it to our common sense reality)

**Data/Statistics**: In an accessible way!!!! Make statistics concrete. Analogies.

“Sinatra Test”: “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere!”

**Testable Credential**: “See by yourself”, “Test before you buy”, “money back if not satisfied”. Offering tangible guarantees.

Believing in your message is important but not enough. The audience can believe it but doesn't care. You must make them care !
