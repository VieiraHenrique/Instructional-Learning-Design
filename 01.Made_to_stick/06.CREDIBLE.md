# CREDIBLE

&rarr; Instilling belief

---

Why do you believe the things you believe ? How can you provide a source of credibility to your message so the audience believe in it ?

### External Credibility

**Authorities**: The president, the police, your mom...

**Experts**: They have studied. They know what they’re talking about.

**Celebrities**: We want to be like them. If they believe this, so do we!

**Anti-authority**: “_concrete authorities_”. People that have been trough. A soldier talking about surviving a war, a Covid survivor talking about being breathless...

### Internal Credibility

**Details**: Makes it seem more real. (Same principle of concreteness: brings it to our common sense reality)

**Data/Statistics**: In an accessible way!!!! Make statistics concrete. Analogies. (Numbers must be auxiliary !)

**“Sinatra Test”**: _“If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere!”_ (If someone did it, why not you ?)

**Testable Credential**: “See by yourself”, “Test before you buy”, “money back if not satisfied”. Offering tangible guarantees that this is legit.

Believing in your message is important but not enough. The audience can believe it but doesn't care. You must make them care !
