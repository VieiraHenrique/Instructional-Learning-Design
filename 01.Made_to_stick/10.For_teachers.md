**Core message**

```
At the end of my course, I want my students

or to remember __________

**Curiosity gaps**

Create questions to be solved later. Don't reveal the answer before.

**Appeal to their senses** and **Tap into emotion**

Make them do something in practice in order to get a feel of it. Make it sensorial.

**Tell stories, stories, stories!!**
