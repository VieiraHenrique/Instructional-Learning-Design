# STORY

&rarr; Making people act.

---

`STORY`, the last of our list, is not a trait. It's a _form_. It's **how** we should apply all the precedent traits.

**Stories** have two separate important strenghts :

- **SIMULATION** &rarr; Gives us knowledge about how to act.
- **INSPIRATION** &rarr; Motivation to act.

For any message...

### TELL A STORY !

Some things are more up to be told as stories. But think of data... how can I tell a story about data ? Well... data is a collection and a summary of hundreds or thousands of individual stories ! Pick a representative story from the insights provided form your data and tell that story.
