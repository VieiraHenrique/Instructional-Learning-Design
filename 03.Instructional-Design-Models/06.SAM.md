# SAM Model

---

Here's a breakdown of the SAM model in an easy-to-understand way:

Imagine you're building an eLearning course, but instead of aiming for perfection right away, you focus on getting a good enough version out there quickly. Then, you gather feedback and use it to make improvements in small, iterative steps. That's the core idea behind the SAM model.

Here are the key stages of the SAM model:

- **Preparation**: This stage involves gathering information about your learners and the topic you'll be teaching. It's like laying the groundwork for your course.
- **Iterative Design**: Here's where the magic happens! You create a basic version of your course content, including prototypes for activities and assessments. This might involve storyboards, scripts, or even rough drafts. The focus is on getting something functional out there quickly.
- **Iterative Development**: Once you have a basic version, it's time to test it out with a small group of learners. This is where you gather feedback and see what's working well and what needs improvement. Based on this feedback, you refine your course content and activities in small steps.

Think of it like building a house:

- **Preparation** - Gathering materials (information)
- **Iterative Design** - Building the frame (basic course structure)
- **Iterative Development** - Adding walls, roof, and finishing touches (refining based on feedback)

Here are some advantages of using the SAM model for eLearning:

- **Faster** Development: You can get a basic course out there quicker and start gathering feedback sooner.
- **Flexibility**: The iterative approach allows you to adapt the course based on learner needs.
- **Cost-Effective**: Catching issues early through small-scale testing can prevent costly rework later.

Overall, the SAM model is a powerful tool for creating effective eLearning experiences in a time-efficient and adaptable way. It's like a recipe for building successful eLearning courses â€“ start with a solid foundation, test and refine along the way, and enjoy a delicious learning outcome!
