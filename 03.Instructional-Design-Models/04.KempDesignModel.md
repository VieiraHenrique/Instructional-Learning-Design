# Kemp Design Model

---

Here's the Kemp Design Model explained in a casual way, perfect for building engaging eLearning experiences:

Imagine you're crafting an online course, like teaching photography or mastering public speaking. The Kemp Design Model is your guide to making it informative and interactive. It's like a compass, ensuring you don't get lost and learners actually reach their learning goals.

Here's how it translates to the eLearning world:

1. ##### Identify the Problem (and the Solution!):

- Before diving in, figure out the gap you're trying to bridge. Do your learners need to capture stunning photos or deliver captivating presentations? This is your instructional problem.
- Then, define the solution â€“ your amazing eLearning course!

2. ##### Who are Your Star Learners?

- Not everyone learns the same way. Some folks are visual learners who thrive on images, while others prefer hands-on activities. Understanding your target audience (age, experience level, etc.) helps tailor the course to their needs. This makes them the stars of the learning show!

3. ##### Learning Goals: Setting the Stage

- What do you want your learners to achieve by the end of the course? Do you want them to identify different camera settings or deliver a speech with confidence? These are your learning objectives. Think of them as setting the stage for the learning journey.

4. ##### Developing the Content: Lights, Camera, Action!

- This is where you create the actual course content. The Kemp Model suggests a logical flow, but you have the flexibility to structure it based on your content. Think of incorporating multimedia (videos, images), interactive exercises, and downloadable resources to keep learners engaged. It's like creating a captivating learning experience!

5. ##### Picking the Perfect Activities:

- Just like a good movie has different scenes, your eLearning course needs a variety of activities. Imagine incorporating quizzes, simulations, discussions, or even creating photo challenges! These activities should directly connect to your learning objectives, keeping things interesting and helping learners retain information.

6. ##### Learner Support: The Helping Hand

- Even the best courses can have tricky bits. The Kemp Model emphasizes the importance of learner support. This could involve including FAQs, discussion forums, or even offering live chat support within the eLearning platform. Think of it as providing a helping hand throughout the learning journey.

7. ##### Evaluation: Curtain Call and Feedback

- How will you know if your course is a success? Evaluation is key! This could involve quizzes, project submissions, or even course surveys. Analyze the results to see if learners achieved the learning objectives. This is like getting feedback after the curtain call to improve future performances (courses)!

8. ##### Think Big and Make Improvements:

- The Kemp Model encourages you to think beyond the first iteration of your course. Use the evaluation results to identify areas for improvement. Maybe you can add new activities, refine the content, or explore different assessment methods.

9. ##### Flexibility is Your Friend:

- Unlike some instructional design models, the Kemp Model is known for its flexibility. You don't have to follow the steps in a strict order. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure approach! Focus on the aspects most relevant to your course and learner needs.

The Kemp Model supports simultaneous phases.

By following these steps, the Kemp Design Model empowers you to create eLearning courses that are not only informative but also engaging and effective. It's like a roadmap to learning success!
