### The Backwards Model for eLearning: Flipping the Script on Learning Design

Imagine designing an eLearning course like planning a thrilling movie. The Backwards Model throws out the traditional script and starts with the climax – what you want learners to achieve by the end. Here's how it flips the script for eLearning:

1. ##### Start with the Big Finish: What Do You Want Them to Do?

Instead of diving headfirst into content, this model asks, "What will learners be able to DO after completing the course?" Do you want them to troubleshoot technical problems, design a killer marketing campaign, or write a persuasive essay? These become your learning outcomes. They're like the movie's epic finale – the ultimate goal.

2. ##### Building the Bridge: Evidence of Success

Now, you need to figure out how to get learners to that epic finale. What evidence will prove they've mastered the skills? This could be creating a project, passing a final assessment, or successfully solving a real-world scenario. These are your **assessment strategies**. They're like building the bridge that leads learners to the satisfying conclusion.

3. ##### Designing the Journey: Activities for Mastery

Finally, you design the actual learning experiences. What activities will help learners acquire the skills needed to achieve the learning outcomes? This could involve interactive exercises, simulations, quizzes, or collaborative learning projects. Think of them as the exciting scenes and challenges that lead to the movie's climax.

#### Benefits of Flipping the Script:

- **Learner-Centered Design:** The Backwards Model focuses on what learners need to do, ensuring the course is relevant and practical.
- **Clear Learning Path:** With the end goal in mind, it's easier to create a logical and focused learning journey.
- **Effective Assessment:** Assessments directly tie back to the desired outcomes, ensuring they measure the right skills.

The Backwards Model for eLearning isn't about memorizing facts, it's about empowering learners to take action! It's like crafting an eLearning experience that's both engaging and impactful, leaving learners feeling like they've just conquered their own learning adventure!
