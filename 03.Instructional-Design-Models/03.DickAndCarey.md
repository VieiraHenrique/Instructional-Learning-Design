# Dick and Carey Model

---

The Dick and Carey Model, also known as the _Systems Approach Model_, is a powerful tool for designing effective learning experiences. It takes a systematic approach, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various elements that contribute to successful learning. Here's how it applies to eLearning:

```
Identify Instructional Goals
Conduct Instructional Analysis
Analyze Learner Entry Behaviors & Characteristics
Write Performance Objectives
Develop Criterion-Referenced Assessment
Develop Instructional Strategy
Select Instructional Materials
Develop Instructional Activities
Conduct Formative Evaluation
```

Imagine you're building an online course, like teaching people how to code or mastering the art of baking bread. The Dick and Carey Model is basically your blueprint for making that course awesome. It's like a checklist to ensure you're covering all the bases and learners actually walk away with the skills you set out to teach.

Here's how it translates to the world of eLearning:

1. ##### Start with the Finish Line:

- Before diving in, figure out what you want people to achieve by the end of the course. Do you want them to be coding whizzes or baking bread masterpieces? These are your learning goals.
- Then, break those goals down into smaller, specific steps. Think: "By the end of this module, learners will be able to identify the five basic coding languages." These are your learning objectives.

2. ##### Know Your Students (Virtually):

- Not everyone learns the same way. Some folks prefer videos, while others love hands-on activities. Understanding your target audience (age, tech skills, etc.) helps tailor the eLearning experience to their needs. Think of it as customizing the learning journey for each student.

3. ##### Set the Expectations:

- Imagine the course description as a contract between you and the learner. Clearly outline what knowledge or skills they should already have before starting (like some basic computer knowledge for coding) This is like setting the entry requirements for the course.

4. ##### Make Learning Measurable:

- How will you know if your students are mastering the material? That's where assessments come in. Think quizzes, interactive exercises, or even baking challenges! These should directly tie back to the learning objectives you defined earlier.

5. ##### Design Engaging Activities (Think Beyond Textbooks!):

- Nobody wants to stare at a wall of text all day. The Dick and Carey Model encourages using a variety of activities to keep learners hooked. Imagine incorporating coding simulations, fun quizzes, or even video demonstrations of different baking techniques.

6. ##### Test It Out Before Unleashing It on the World:

- Imagine building a prototype of your course before launching it to everyone. This is called formative evaluation. Get a small group of learners to test it out and see if there are any confusing bits or areas that need improvement.

7. ##### See How It Performs After Launch:

- Once your course is out there, it's time to see how well it's doing. This is summative evaluation. Analyze learner results, gather feedback through surveys, and see if your students are achieving those baking or coding goals!

By following these steps, the Dick and Carey Model ensures you're building an eLearning course that's not just informative, but truly effective. It's like a recipe for learning success!
