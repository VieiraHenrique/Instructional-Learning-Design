# Identify With Your Audience

Many trainers focus on what they want rather than what the audience wants.

(order of importance : )

1. Why they'd want what you are giving them (emotional reasons why they are attracted to what you have to say)
2. How I will give it to them ?
3. What your audience wants The reasons they would say they are coming to hear your training)
