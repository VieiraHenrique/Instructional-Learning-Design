# Portfolio

---

### Five principles :

**One**

- People that look to your portfolio are not looking to learn.
- They want a grasp of your work.

---

- It's tempting to create a 30-min module for people to see and "example course" but don't !

- Recruters and hiting managers want to get a taste for what you can do and get clarity that you know what you are talking about.

- Create 3 x 5 minutes modules. This means if people want to go deeper then they can, but it saves you time to focus on providing context.

**Two**

Context is crucial !

Use WWWWWH

- Why
- Where
- What
- When
- Who
- How

- The viewer wants to know how this portfolio item relates to the context of the role/work request.

- Provide context to demonstrate not only the tools you can use but also your design process.

  - Written forms
  - Video to screen record
  - Talk through how you created it, build the module and the tought process.

- Provide details such as what is the learning requirement, who are the learners, where would this be accessed (phone/desktop). When was this created (using which tool ?)

---

**Three**

Use your imagination !

- Use existing briefs to provide you with context and a "real world" problem to solve.

---

**Four**

(Technical part to host. I don't need it.)

---

**Five**

What do you want people to do next ?

You have their attention. Now what ?
