# Mayerâ€™s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning

Richard Mayer.

1. How to use multimedia to replace face-to-face learning ? And how to use multimedia to replace text ?

2. Cognitive overload.

**Cognitive overload** looks at how we're not overpowering the senses in our presentations.

If someone is showing a text and reading at the same time this text, what are we supposed to do ? Listen to him ? Read ?...

We must not overload our attention. It distracts the learner.
