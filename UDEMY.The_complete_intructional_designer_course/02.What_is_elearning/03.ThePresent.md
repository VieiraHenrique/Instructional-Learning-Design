# The present

### 01. Formal

---

**Synchrounous vs Asynchronous**

**Synchronous** is happening at the same time for all (can be front-to-front, webinar...)

**Asynchronous**

- At a time that suits the learner
- Allow people to lear at their speed.
- Can delve deeper where needed

We learn at different speeds ! Sometimes we go fast for some materials, sometimes slower.

People will have the material later on as well

(Flipped classrooms can be a very nice option)

---

**Digital learning in different mediums**

- Authoring tools (softwares that are designed to provide elearning experiences)

- Videos

- Podcasts

- Articles

AI can help us a lot to write copies.

Quality is key !! No bad images or **sound** !

**Creatin and curation**

_Content curation is the process of gathering information relevant to a particular topic or area of interest, usually with the intention of adding value through the process of selecting, organizing and looking after the items that are relevant for our goals_

When curating :

- Identify what we want to acomplish
- Identify source content
- Critique the content (is it right ? relevant ? reputable source ?)
- Create an experience (how do we provide the content, not too long, bite sizes)
- Publish your resource (which platform ? Where to publish it ?)
- Housekeeping (Make sure the content is still acessible, still relevant...)
- Investigate (look if people are engaged in what, etc.)

---

**Platforms**

Where to host our course ?

- eLearning platforms ? (easy and ability to analyze data)

---

### Informal

---

**Learning the flow**

- Make sure to be able to provide people with the answers they need to questions, being able to provide a resource that they need when they need it, and also being easily searchable and bite sized.

---

**Non traditional learning platforms**

- Goole (search)
- YouTube
- Twitter ? TikTok ? Instagram ?

Short answers on Instagram for example. "**How do I do something ? I don't want to take a full course**".
