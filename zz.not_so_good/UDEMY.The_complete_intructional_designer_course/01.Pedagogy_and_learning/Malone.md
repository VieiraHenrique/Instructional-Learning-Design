# Maloneâ€™s Theory of Intrinsically Motivating Instruction

---

Three major concepts in the learning process :

1. Challenge
2. Fantasy
3. Curiousity

---

#### Challenge

The difficulty of the challenge increases and we gain rewards at each step.

**(What's in it for me ?)**

#### Fantasy

It's about being able to take our minds elsewhere to put ourselves in situations to further explore and want to gain that knowledge.

#### Curiosity

It's about "why do I need this information" but also what's going to be the benefits. And how many more benefits can I gain ?

**GAMIFICATION!!!!**

---

- Engage learners
- Reward learners
- Feed them more information.
