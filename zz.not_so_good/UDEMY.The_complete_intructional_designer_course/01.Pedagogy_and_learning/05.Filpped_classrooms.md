# Flipped Classrooms

---

Flip the conventional way. Which is :

- Present the content in the teacher's pace.
- Then exercise by homework etc.

Flipped classroom aims to the opposite :

- Allowing people to learn at their own pace, get the knowledge they need, to, then, be able to go further thanks to discussion, social learning, being able to exchange ideas, etc.

Did you know a study has showed that we forget 70% of what we learned within 24 hours ?

How can we improve this ? Is repetition of knowledge in order to really make it stick a good way ?
