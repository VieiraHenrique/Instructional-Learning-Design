# The past of learning

---

- Mainly someone speaking at us
- Cramming for tests (bourrer de tests)
- Focus on short-term recollection
- People in the same place at a designated time/date

It didn't take into account what was going on with the learner, how they learned.

For many people, having this "one-direction" flow didn't resonate with them.

Other problems :

- Information overload
- We are human, we forget.
- We miss information if we are distracted or sick.
- Maybe the person who is teaching is not engaging --> difficult to recollect information.
