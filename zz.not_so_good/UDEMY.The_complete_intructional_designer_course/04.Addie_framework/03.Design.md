**Subject Matter Expert**

- If we don't have enough ressources with google, ia, youtube... Think of hetting an expert.

**Micro-learning**

Historically learning was between 45 min and 1h long. Which can be very long to keep all the information.

Microlearning breaks down information.

1h long material should be break down to 6 times 10 minutes for example.

**Interactive videos**

Authoring **storyline** allows us to put buttons in a video to go further in explanations.

**Storytelling**

Create characters for example to go through the material with theu story.

**Gamification**

Bad learning + gamification = BAD experience.

- Providing scenarios/storytelling
- Safe immersive environments
- Rewards

**Look and feel**

We expect so much on how things look.Never minimize the graphic design aspect of it.
